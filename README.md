Step by step instructions to build and test an OpenAPI 3.0 example application can be found at https://github.com/ibm-build-lab/Custom-Extensions/blob/main/byoai_v2.1.md

The instructions assist to perform the following tasks:
```
1.) Create a simple REST-API
2.) Containerize the REST-API
3.) House the containerized version in the IBM Registry
4.) Deploy the application via IBM Code-Engine
5.) Modify the application for OpenAPI 3.0 compliance. 
```
